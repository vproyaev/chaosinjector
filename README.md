**Inject Chaos, Control Uncertainty ‚Äì Revolutionize Your Python Code with
Probabilistic Proxies!**

Imagine turning any Python object into a probabilistic powerhouse: methods
that "flake out" randomly, logs that sample themselves, tests that simulate
real-world failures without a single line of mocking code. **ChaosInjector** is
the ultimate tool for developers who crave dynamic, resilient, and innovative
code. Whether you're hardening your app against flakiness, optimizing
performance through sampling, or adding randomness to simulations and games ‚Äì
ChaosInjector makes it effortless and elegant.

Why settle for static code when you can embrace controlled chaos? Join the ranks
of forward-thinking devs using ChaosInjector to supercharge testing, logging, AI
behaviors, and more. **Install now and unlock the power of probability!**

## Why ChaosInjector? üî•

In a world of unpredictable systems, ChaosInjector gives you the edge:

- **Fault Injection on Steroids**: Simulate flaky networks, databases, or APIs
  with a single line ‚Äì perfect for robust unit/integration tests.
- **Performance Sampling Magic**: Reduce overhead in logging, tracing, or
  analytics by executing only X% of the time.
- **Stochastic Simulations**: Add realistic randomness to games, ML models, or
  Monte Carlo methods without rewriting logic.
- **A/B Testing Simplified**: Roll out features probabilistically, no complex
  infra needed.
- **Privacy & Security Boost**: Anonymize sensitive data accesses randomly for
  compliance and honeypots.

Built with Python's dynamic magic (runtime class proxying
via `__getattribute__`), ChaosInjector is lightweight, zero-dependency, and
battle-tested with full coverage. It's not just a library ‚Äì it's your secret
weapon for smarter, more adaptive code.

## Quick Start ‚ö°

### Installation

Get started in seconds:

```bash
pip install chaosinjector
```

### Basic Usage

Suppress logs probabilistically? Easy!

```python
import logging
from chaosinjector import ChaosInjector


logger = logging.getLogger("my_app")
ChaosInjector.inject(logger, probability=0.1)  # Only 10% chance logs execute

logger.info("This might not log!")  # Flaky by design!
```

Want more control? Use deciders or per-method probs:

```python
ChaosInjector.inject(
    logger, method_probs={"info": 0.0, "error": 1.0}
)  # Info always skipped, errors always log
```

Or custom logic:

```python
ChaosInjector.inject(
    logger, decider=lambda name: "debug" not in name
)  # Skip all debug methods
```

### Creating a Proxy Without Mutating the Original

For cases where you need to keep the original object untouched,
use `create_proxy`, which returns a new object with chaos applied, preserving
type hints:

```python
import logging
from chaosinjector import ChaosInjector


original_logger = logging.getLogger("my_app")
chaos_logger = ChaosInjector.create_proxy(original_logger, probability=0.1)

chaos_logger.info("This log is flaky in the proxy!")  # 10% chance in proxy
original_logger.info("This log always works!")  # Original untouched
```

## Features at a Glance üåü

- **Probabilistic Attribute Access**: Return real attributes/methods with
  tunable probability (0.0-1.0).
- **Custom Deciders**: Pass a callable to decide per-attribute (e.g., based on
  name, env vars, or time).
- **Per-Method Granularity**: Dict of method-specific probabilities for
  fine-tuned control.
- **Safe No-Op Handling**: Callables become silent lambdas; non-callables return
  None ‚Äì no crashes!
- **Validation Built-In**: Ensures probabilities are valid (0-1), preventing
  silent errors.
- **Type Preservation**: Proxies maintain isinstance compatibility with the
  original type, including generics and type hints.
- **Dual Modes**: In-place mutation via `inject` or non-destructive proxy
  via `create_proxy`.
- **Lightweight & Pure Python**: No dependencies, works with Python 3.8+.
- **Extensively Tested**: 100% coverage with pytest, including mocked randomness
  for determinism.

## Real-World Examples üí°

### 1. Fault Injection in Tests

Simulate unreliable services:

```python
import requests
from chaosinjector import ChaosInjector


session = requests.Session()
ChaosInjector.inject(session, probability=0.3)  # 70% failure rate

response = session.get(
    "https://api.example.com"
)  # Often None ‚Äì test your retries!
```

Or without mutation:

```python
chaos_session = ChaosInjector.create_proxy(session, probability=0.3)
response = chaos_session.get("https://api.example.com")  # Flaky only in proxy
```

### 2. Sampling Expensive Operations

Optimize tracing:

```python
from opentelemetry import trace
from chaosinjector import ChaosInjector


tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)
ChaosInjector.inject(tracer, probability=0.1)  # Trace only 10% of calls

with tracer.start_as_current_span("operation"):  # Sometimes no-op
    pass
```

With proxy:

```python
chaos_tracer = ChaosInjector.create_proxy(tracer, probability=0.1)
with chaos_tracer.start_as_current_span(
    "operation"
):  # Flaky in proxy, original intact
    pass
```

### 3. Probabilistic AI in Games

Add unpredictability:

```python
class NPC:
    def attack(self):
        print("Boom!")


npc = NPC()
ChaosInjector.inject(
    npc, method_probs={"attack": 0.7}
)  # Attacks 70% of the time

npc.attack()  # Maybe... maybe not!
```

With proxy:

```python
chaos_npc = ChaosInjector.create_proxy(npc, method_probs={"attack": 0.7})
chaos_npc.attack()  # Flaky in proxy, original npc stable
```

### 4. Data Privacy Masking

Anonymize sensitive fields:

```python
class UserData:
    user_id = "sensitive123"


data = UserData()
ChaosInjector.inject(
    data, decider=lambda name: name != "user_id"
)  # user_id always None

print(data.user_id)  # None ‚Äì protected!
```

With proxy:

```python
chaos_data = ChaosInjector.create_proxy(
    data, decider=lambda name: name != "user_id"
)
print(chaos_data.user_id)  # None in proxy, original untouched
```
